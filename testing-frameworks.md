# Testing Frameworks for .NET Development Team

## Unit Testing with NUnit

NUnit is the preferred testing framework for unit tests in our .NET projects. It provides a robust and flexible way to write and run tests, ensuring our code is reliable and maintainable.

### General Standards for NUnit

1. **Test Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive names for test methods that clearly indicate what is being tested.
   - Follow the pattern: `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`.

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Arrange: Set up any objects and prepare the prerequisites for your test.
   - Act: Perform the action that you want to test.
   - Assert: Verify that the action behaved as expected.

3. **Test Categories**:
   - Use `[Category("CategoryName")]` to group tests into categories for easier management and execution.

4. **Assertions**:
   - Use `Assert` methods to verify the expected outcomes.
   - Prefer `Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual)` over `Assert.IsTrue(condition)` for better readability.

5. **Setup and Teardown**:
   - Use `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]` attributes to run code before and after each test.
   - Use `[OneTimeSetUp]` and `[OneTimeTearDown]` for code that needs to run once before and after all tests in a fixture.

## UI Testing with Playwright

Playwright is the approved framework for UI testing. It allows for end-to-end testing of web applications, ensuring that the user interface behaves as expected.

### General Best Practices for Playwright

1. **Test Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive names for test methods that clearly indicate the user scenario being tested.
   - Follow the pattern: `Scenario_ExpectedOutcome`.

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Arrange: Set up the initial state of the application.
   - Act: Perform the user actions that you want to test.
   - Assert: Verify that the UI behaves as expected.

3. **Selectors**:
   - Use stable and unique selectors to locate elements.
   - Prefer data-test attributes for selectors to avoid changes due to UI modifications.

4. **Assertions**:
   - Use Playwright's built-in assertion methods to verify the expected outcomes.
   - Ensure assertions are specific and provide clear failure messages.

5. **Setup and Teardown**:
   - Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to run code before and after each test.
   - Use `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks for code that needs to run once before and after all tests in a suite.

6. **Test Isolation**:
   - Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order.
   - Avoid shared state between tests to prevent flaky tests.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these standards and best practices, our .NET development team can ensure that our code is thoroughly tested and reliable. NUnit and Playwright provide powerful tools for unit and UI testing, respectively, helping us maintain high-quality software.
