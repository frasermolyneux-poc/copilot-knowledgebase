# Secrets Management

## Key Vault for Secrets Management

Key Vault is our preferred solution for managing secrets, such as API keys, connection strings, and other sensitive information. It provides a secure and centralised way to store and access secrets, ensuring that our applications remain secure.

### General Standards for Key Vault

1. **Secret Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive names for secrets that clearly indicate their purpose.
   - Follow the pattern: `ApplicationName_Environment_SecretName`.

2. **Access Policies**:
   - Define access policies to control who and what can access the secrets.
   - Use least privilege principle to grant only the necessary permissions.

3. **Secret Rotation**:
   - Implement regular secret rotation policies to enhance security.
   - Use automated tools to rotate secrets and update dependent applications.

4. **Auditing and Monitoring**:
   - Enable logging and monitoring to track access and changes to secrets.
   - Regularly review audit logs to detect any suspicious activities.

5. **Integration with Applications**:
   - Use Key Vault SDKs or REST APIs to integrate secrets into applications.
   - Ensure that secrets are not hardcoded in the application code.

## App Configuration for Configuration Management

App Configuration is used alongside Key Vault to manage application settings and configurations. It provides a centralised way to manage configuration values, ensuring consistency and ease of management.

### General Best Practices for App Configuration

1. **Configuration Naming Conventions**:
   - Use hierarchical naming for configuration keys to organise settings logically.
   - Follow the pattern: `ApplicationName:Environment:SettingName`.

2. **Versioning**:
   - Maintain versioned configurations to manage changes and rollbacks.
   - Use labels to differentiate between different versions and environments.

3. **Access Policies**:
   - Define access policies to control who can read and write configurations.
   - Use least privilege principle to grant only the necessary permissions.

4. **Integration with Key Vault**:
   - Store sensitive configuration values in Key Vault and reference them in App Configuration.
   - Use Key Vault references to securely access secrets from App Configuration.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Enable monitoring and set up alerts for changes to configuration values.
   - Regularly review configuration changes to ensure they are authorised and expected.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these standards and best practices, our .NET development team can ensure that secrets and configurations are managed securely and efficiently. Key Vault and App Configuration provide powerful tools for managing sensitive information and application settings, helping us maintain high-quality and secure software.
